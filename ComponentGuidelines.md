## Labels (Buttons, Hyperlinks, Headings, etc.) Follow Case Guidelines
- Title Case (5 words or less) or Sentence case (6 words or more). 
- Note: exceptions are allowed to keep the labels on the page consistent
- Heading 1 is only used for the page title and can always be Title Case (unless it is an article name following specific editorial guidelines). When a Heading 1 page title is at the top of the page without a banner - put 24 px above and 24 px below the title.
- Heading 2 is used for all subheadings with H3 used for subs of those and H4 for subs of 3 and so on.
- Buttons / hyperlinks would ideally have less than 6 words and be in Title Case. The goal should be to have shorter labels for these as they do not present well when they wrap to more than one line.
- Ampersands can be used to shorten labels for titles and buttons.
